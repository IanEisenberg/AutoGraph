TASK:
Your task is to update a document for the following entity based on it's usage in the following series of summaries.
You will also receive the latest version of this entity's document.
Be sure to update the description based on the information contained in the documents without forgetting the information you already had.
This should be a refinement of the existing information based on new inputs.
You should include only new information that is included in the summary and limit your external assumptions.
Try to be thorough about the content covered as this note might be referenced alone, without the other content.
You should reference any other entities that are tagged (linked, in the markdown way), as well as relevant known entities.
