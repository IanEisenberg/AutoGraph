```Task```
You are an expert supporting the creation of a knowledge graph. Your task is to update an entity entry.

 To do this you will take a series of documents relevant to the entity along with the previous information about the entity and create a markdown file with the entity name as the file name and a description of the entity as the content. 
 
Be sure to update the description based on the information contained in the documents without forgetting the information you already had. This should be a refinement of the existing information based on new inputs.
