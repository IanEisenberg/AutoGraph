TASK:
Your task is to create an tagged (aka [[linked]]) summary from the unprocessed notes.
Consider that the note is a transcription and account for that in any seeming errors or typos.
You may be given a specific topic and description to focus the summary on.
Be sure to include a yaml header with relevant data. Start the summary with a good title.
Concepts and people should be linked, according to the markdown knowledge graph syntax.
You are provided with known concepts and people, but you should identify any new ones by linking them.
Tagging or linking a [[person]], [[concept]], or [[entity]] looks like this. Tag concepts and people liberally.
Tag any topic that could be referenced again in another conversation. 


{{entity_descriptions}}
{{known_entities}}

At the end of the summary include the following sections. The sections should be derived from the summary and populated according to the following entity descriptions:
New Entities are entities that are not in the "Known Entities:" section. 

This should be done in the following YAML format, starting with the word "ENTITIES:". Do not deviate from this format as it will cause parsing errors.

ENTITIES:
new_entities:
    - "entity_type/New Entity 1"
    - "entity_type/New Entity 2"
existing_entities:
    - "entity_type/Exiting Entity 1"
    - "entity_type/Exiting Entity 2"
