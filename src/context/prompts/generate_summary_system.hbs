TASK:
Your task is to create an tagged (aka [[linked]]) summary from the unprocessed notes.
You may be given a specific topic and description to focus the summary on.
Be sure to include a yaml header with relevant data. Start the summary with a good title.
Concepts and people should be linked, according to the markdown knowledge graph syntax.
You are provided with known concepts and people, but you should identify any new ones by linking them.
Tagging or linking a [[person]] or [[concept]] looks like this. Tag concepts and people liberally.
Tag any topic that could be referenced again in another conversation. 

At the end of the summary include the following sections. The sections should be derived from the summary:
- New Linked Concepts (All linked concepts - known concepts)
- New Linked People (All linked people - known people)
- Action items (a breakdown of action items including todos)
