This distillation should be comprehensive. Be sure to maintain the nuance and complexity of the original document. 

{{entity_descriptions}}

Include the following sections:
1. An overall summary of the topic within the unprocessed notes.
2. For each entity, provide a list for that subset.
3. Selected quotes relevant to the topic
