AutoGraph takes unstructured data and outputs a knowledge graph in the form of markdown files to be visualized by Obsidian.

Based on previous work done [here](https://github.com/skgbafa/llm-knowledge-graph)

## Autograph can be run from the CLI against a specific file as follows
```
pnpm cli process <file>
```

Be sure to modify the config.json to focus on the things you care about.
